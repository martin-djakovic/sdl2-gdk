The goal of this project is to make development of simple 2D games in C++ easier, and keep code cleaner. SDL2-GDK is designed to be a lightweight, but reasonably capable 2D game engine. It utilizes the graphical capabilities of the SDL2 library, but provides classes and functions specifically tailored to 2D game development. It makes drawing images, text, collisions, movement, sprite organization, and many other things a lot simpler to accomplish, saving a lot of time and keeping the game code clean.
